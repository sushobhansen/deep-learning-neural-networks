# Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Code that I developed while reading the e-book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" by Michael A. Nielsen, Determination Press, 2015

Book available [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html), original code [here](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

My code is based on Nielsen's, but was written myself. In the process, I updated parts of it to Python 3.6.
